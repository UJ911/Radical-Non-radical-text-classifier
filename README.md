# Radical-Non-radical-text-classifier

We use roBERTa which is a popular choice for sentimental analysis of text. We fine tune it on our dataset and with the help of transfer learning we classify if the given statement is radical or not.

We also use safe reinforcement learning with human feedback to constantly update the algorithm to do a better job.
